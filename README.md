Electric Vehicle Battery Management System (CEIES Project)

Electric vehicles dominantly use Li-Ion batteries; these batteries have a high energy-to-mass ratio. Moreover, they can also withstand steep charging and discharging cycles with good efficiency. However, Li-Ion batteries are also highly explosive and can deteriorate very quickly if not properly charged and discharged for several cycles. Therefore, there is a need of an intelligent battery management system (BMS). Besides, managing the charging and discharging of the battery in the best possible ways to improve efficiency and extend serviceable life, this system is also responsible for extracting energy from the regenerative braking system of the vehicle. Intelligent methods are used to get information about the SoH (state of health) and SoC (state of charge) besides other parameters. Moreover, efficient algorithms are employed to control the electronics for charging, discharging, and energy recovery
